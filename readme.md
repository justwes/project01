## Project 1 Portfolio

This is my Udacity Nano Degree Portfolio Project.

## Tools and Technology Used

Developed a personal portfolio page using HTML, CSS, Font Awesome, Adobe Font, and the Bootstrap framework. The page is fully responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop browsers.

## Photography

I chose to make the portfolio about my daughter photos I've taken of her. I hve been taking photos of her for nearly 3 years at this point and have been a photographer for far longer.
